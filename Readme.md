# Android app template

This is a template (boilerplate) for building new Android apps on TokenD.
Unlike [our first template project – Android wallet](https://github.com/tokend/android-client), –
this is not a working app. This is just a pre-configured project structure
filled with essential classes used to quickly start a new app development.

## Important notes

To change the name of the project displayed in Android Studio change `rootProject.name` property
in `settings.gradle` file
